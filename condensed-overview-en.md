## Integrated Approach Plan for Creating a Universal Web Application for Image Editing

**Overall Goal:** Develop a scalable and modular foundation for a web application for image processing, including basic and advanced functions (uploading, displaying, analyzing, resizing, support for color spaces and tools).

### 1. Project Initialization and Architecture
- Create a project with Vue 3.
- Define a modular project structure:
    - UI components (based on the selected component library).
    - Common state panel and routing (if separation into tasks is needed).
- Configure a global Vuex store for data exchange between components.

### 2. Common Basic Functionality
- **Image Upload Component:**
    - Implement a universal component for uploading both from a file and via URL.
- **Displaying the Image on a Canvas:**
    - Use the `<canvas>` element to visualize the image.
    - Common module for redrawing the image, taking into account future scaling and offset.
- **Information Panel:**
    - Display basic information about pixels (coordinates, RGB).

### 3. Expanding Functionality Without Changing the Base Code
- **Modal Window for Resizing:**
    - Embed a modal window component for entering image resizing parameters (width, height, aspect ratio preservation, interpolation algorithm selection).
    - Integrate a mechanism for recalculating and redrawing the image within the existing canvas.
- **Image Scaling:**
    - Implement a universal scaling mechanism that allows using a range or dropdown to select the scale.
    - Automatic adjustment taking into account indents and redrawing the image when parameters change.

### 4. Support for Color Spaces and Analysis Tools
- **Color Spaces:**
    - Implement a module for calculating and displaying color values in various spaces (RGB, XYZ, Lab, LCH, OKLch).
- **Toolbar:**
    - Integrate a button/indicator to select the active tool (eyedropper, hand).
    - Create a universal event handler for clicks with modifier support (e.g., for selecting two colors).
- **Tools:**
    - **Eyedropper:** Processing pixel data retrieval, calculating coordinates taking into account scale and offset, outputting color and contrast data.
    - **Hand:** Implement the ability to move the image with restrictions so that the image remains visible.

### 5. Documentation and Extensibility
- Document components and algorithms with links to official documentation, such as the Vue 3 documentation and the general information regarding editing images (such as colour spaces documentation or important features or the use of modules in the code that do the bulk of the work without requiring us to implement them from scratch).
- When developing each module, provide the possibility of easily adding new functions without affecting existing functionality.

**Result:** A universal, modular web application that combines basic functionality and advanced tools with the possibility of further scaling and adding new requirements in the future.
